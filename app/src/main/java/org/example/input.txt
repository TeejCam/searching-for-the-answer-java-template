I am writing a short paragraph to test out my inverted index program. 
Fun fact! This is the first time im learning about inverted indexes. 
It is a very interesting data structure, but it involves maps and lists,
and hashmaps and stuff. So really nothing that I haven't seen before.
I mixed in regular expressions into my code to deal with processing 
text -- its a nice coincidence with my python class that is also on
regular expressions right now. Apples apples Apples apples.
